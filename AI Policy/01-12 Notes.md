# Syllabus stuff
Prof. Frazer:
* Senior fellow at Lawfare
* Senior fellow at Abundance
There are very few people doing AI policy work. It's an easy space to enter from this class!

- Lead discussant - someone who is coming prepared to
	- Help lead the class
	- Probe with interesting questions
	- Ask a lot of questions

* Participation:
	* Big part of the grade!
	* There's a queue to talk. Raise your name tag to enter queue.
	* You raise two fingers to jump the queue to make a very crucial germane and short comment.

- Client assignments:
	- Clients are very busy. Respect their time.
	- Clients expect to get an early call from you to discuss the proposal!
	- Clients expect an early outline.
	- Clients expect to review your final draft and evaluate how useful it is, how good of a collaborator you were.

- If you have a content-based question, ask over the phone or in office hours. NOT over email.

# How To Talk About Public Policy
- Bardock's outline for how to analyze public policy, how to define a public policy problem.
- The goal is to avoid partisan and political analysis. It's about first principles.
- Public policy is not an art, it's a science - not sure if I agree with that..
- Be nuanced - if we think that something is bad, we have the burden of explaining why, proposing alternatives!
- View each other as collaborators - not opponents. We try to find the best idea to match our workflow.

## How do we define a public policy problem?
### Exercise - Grok
- What is the issue?
- Why is it a problem?
- What is the magnitude of that problem?
- What is the harm being experienced? Who is experiencing it?
- Who is sharing this information? Why is this information being shared?

- The Guardian story: 8,000 "de-nudifying" requests to Grok per hour.
	- Put this into context - how does this compare to what's being done on other websites? Who is actually posting these images? What are they doing with these images? Why are they doing this?
	- Why this is useful - helps understanding jurisdiction. Ex: if this is mostly British users, we have to consult UK law. If it's a US company, this isn't as useful.
- The facts you surface are going to shape the conversation - the harms you bring up will influence the response that people will demand.

- Different points of influence:
	- Change user norms
	- Regulate AI model training and outputs
	- Internal company policy - aka soft law.
	- Change the way posts are spread..
	- Legal recourse - new statutes.
- **Notes - not all of these are about legal intervention.**

- Think through the entire spectrum from the softest law to the hardest law (from social norms to all levels the tech stack to internal regulations to to statutory law and constitutions)
	- Norms and expectations on users are difficult to influence. Especially as the userbase becomes more heterogeneous.
	- The tech stack can be very useful - making a change in AWS or Cloudflare can have a huge impact on the internet.

- Outline the factual scenario - the facts that you choose to emphasize are going to have a big impact on the kinds of solutions that you try to implement.
	- Grok - if you read about user conduct, you're going to try to regulate the users. If you read about AI generation, you're going to try to regulate X. If you read about how the AG knew about this and didn't do anything, you're going to go after the AG.

- How / when are we willing to admit that we need to change our current policy approach?
	- Ex: FAA. In early 2000s, FAA wanted to get a new policy that would require infants to get their own seats on airplanes. Their goal was to reduce infant mortality on airplanes.
	- Do babies actually get injured on airplanes? Is getting their own seat actually going to reduce injuries?
	- Are airlines involved in advocating for this?
	- Sometimes the right answer is to do nothing! Sometimes the right answer is to study something!
	- Actual result: FAA didn't realize secondary effect. If its more expensive to fly, parents will opt to drive instead of fly. This actually increased infant mortality!


- When are norms most effective?
	- When reputation really matters. Anonymity really undermines the effectiveness of norms.
	- Repeat play. Are users going to come back to this community over and over again?
	- Repeat friction - how often are those norms actually going to be enforced? Is it possible to enforce a norm with low friction?
	- Credibility - are people who violate the norms held accountable? Do those norms actually matter? Do people actually follow and enforce the norms?
