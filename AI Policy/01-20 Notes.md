- Tomorrow, we'll focus on Sandboxes - what's a sandbox? Probably in tomorrow's readings
- Texas Responsible AI Governance Act came into force this year!

- What are our criteria? Is this a policy we want to move forward with or not?

- So many of the problems we're discussing here are UX problems. It would be very useful to look UX research on this!!

- Do we want to move forward with this?
	- Think about secondary and tertiary outcomes. Are we accounting for the unknown ramifications.
		- Is teen mental health better when they don't have access to an AI companion? Are there other readily available resources
	- How much does it cost? In terms of enforcement, challenges in court. What about the cost to developers?
	- In terms of training - what does it mean to train a model to do something with reasonable care?
	- What are the metrics we're judging this problem by? What does this look like right now? What are the goals we're aiming for?


- Why is the organ donation opt in vs opt out problem so easy to solve?
	- It's a binary choice - do you opt in or opt out? It's very easy to measure.
	- It's very easy to see the connection between needing more organ donations and this policy.
	- Even if there's a clear public policy strategy, we still have to ask about the broader moral ramifications of it.

- Tons of surveys show that parents feel like they don't know enough about AI in order to properly set boundaries for their children.


## Symbolic/Political Policy
- Sometimes policy gets passed not because it's the most effective thing, but because of political considerations. This is the point of the Stop Making CEO Pay a Political Issue article.
- A lot of major corporations have private governance or internal governance mechanisms. This will probably become important for us in our client project.
