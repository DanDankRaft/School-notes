"It is clear that the federal regulations at issue in *Bernstein* attempt roughly to acknowledge this point by distinguishing between encryption source code in 'a printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption source code,' and 'encryption source code in electronic form or media...'"[^1]

ANOTHER IMPORTANT CASE TO LOOK AT: *Junger v. Daley*, 209 F.3d 481. Held that source code "is an expressive means for the exchange of information and ideas about computer programming," and therefore protected by 1A.

YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT CASE: *Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley*, 273 F.3d 429. Held that both source code and object code are protected by 1A, because both can be read and understood by some people ("experienced programmers"). "But the fact that a program has the capacity to convey information, and it is the conveying of information that renders instructions 'speech' for purposes of the First Amendment."
"A programmer reading a program learns informations about instructing a computer, and might use this information to improve personal programming skills and perhaps the craft of programming."

HUGELY IMPORTANT QUOTE HERE - "Given the virtually instantaneous and worldwide dissemination widely available via the internet, the only rational assumption is that once a computer program capable of \[performing some functionality\] is disseminated, it will be used."

YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT CASE AND HOW ITS DISTINGUISHED FROM UNIVERSAL: *Commodity Features Trading Com'n v. Vartuli*, 228 F.3d 94. Defendant sold a computer program that gave commodity trading advice that users were meant to mechanically follow (It would tell users to "BUY NOW" or "SELL NOW"). FTC issued an order to stop selling it because of deceptive marketing or fraud or smthn idk. One of D's argments was that this was *prior restraint* on their ability to tell people to "BUY NOW" and "SELL NOW." According to *Universal*: There are three ways in which a programmer may communicate through code:
1. To the user of the program ("BUY NOW/SELL NOW") - not necessarily protected
2. To the computer running the program - never protected
3. To another programmer - always protected
