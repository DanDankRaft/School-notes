# What is coverage?
If something is covered by the first amendment, that means regulations on it merit a first amendment inquiry.
## Why do we need coverage?
Imagine the following scenario:
* Texas passes a law banning a certain type of contractual clause.
* Plaintiff sues the state, arguing that the law restricts his speech because contractual clauses are a type of speech.
> [!warning] Most social activity involves something that could be realistically argued as "speech."
> Coverage is the filter we use to determine which types of actions don't merit first amendment scrutiny.
> **Without a coverage test, the government would not be able to regulate *any* conduct under the first amendment.**
* The problem: coverage tests in practice typically look like one of the following:
	* Never acknowledged, because the conduct is obviously "speech"
	* The case get laughed out of the courtroom, because the conduct is obviously not "speech"
* **TODO** I've heard somewhere that a broad theory of coverage is a kind of "first amendment Lochnerism." What does that mean?
* This doesn't help us! It means there is very little descriptive theory as to what coverage looks like!!
# Theories of coverage
Robert post - "First Amendment Coverage is triggered by those forms of social interaction that realize First Amendment values."[^1]
* We therefore need a "grand theoretical framework" of what those First Amendment Values actually are.[^2]
* If anything, the first amendment covers **anything** that 'realizes first amendment values,' even if it isn't typical speech. So, for example, if a state bans use of film projectors without a license, the first amendment plays a role in whether that licensing scheme is constitutional, because using film projectors is an integral social interaction necessary to facilitate cinema, and the form of this licensing scheme could have "important effects" on what kinds of movies get created and played in the first place.
* IE, once we decide that something is "a significant medium for the communication of ideas," it serves 1A values. Therefore, any regulation on something integral for that medium of communication
