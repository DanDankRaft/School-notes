# Putting Equal Opportunity in context
- Equality of what? What are we trying to distribute equally across society?
- What's the function/goal of equality? Is it to reach perfect equality? What is the normative commitment that pushes us here? How do we translate that to real-world values and outcomes?


- Equal opportunity is an answer to the second question - what are we distributing equally here? Opportunity.

# What does Equal Opportunity mean?
- Equal chance at certain goals in life - a probabilistic things.
- Equal footing - we all play by *fair* rules when it comes to succeeding in life. We distribute *opportunity* equally. We're explicitly not concerned with the outcomes of who end up being the winners and losers of that race.
- Antidiscrimination - a very basic idea of equal opportunity. Nobody should get less or have a harder time in the game because of some prejudice towards the group that they belong to.
- A lot of economists say we have to go further than antidiscrimination. One example: the fate of your parents shouldn't determine the level of opportunity you have.
- Bracha: antidiscrimination is like the "weak" version of equal opportunity, and the fate of your parents is the "strong" version of equal opportunity.

# Why is Equal Opportunity so attractive to liberal thinkers?
- One perspective: it's quite surface-level and requires relatively little systemic change compared to others.
- Dark horse argument: equal opportunity is a way for creating a moral justification for inequality and hierarchy. Who is at the top? The people who *deserve it*. It's a way of creating *meritocracy*
- It prioritizes *individual responsibility* which is one of those liberal values we talked about last week.
	- Dworkin's *equal respect* - nobody should decide for you what you should do with your life and what a good life for you looks like. Equal opportunity is away of achieving a hands-off or libertarian approach to equality.
- Attractive from an economic good or social good perspective: its an effective instrument at achieving the most material wealth - if we elevate 
- Equal opportunity is a critique / response to "old school" egalitarians who argued for sameness - Soviet Style Communism.
	- Dworkin talked about it last weeks.
	- Frederick Hayek - a commitment to substantive equality is a commitment to some "end state" that we then desperately try to maintain. What does this lead to? Dysfunctional economies (like the Soviet Union) and extensive government intervention, which is an invitation for abuse and authoritarianism (like the Soviet Union)

- Case study: Texas Law application asked if you were able to take an LSAT prep course. It's about controlling for circumstantial variables when judging candidates.

> [!info] Next steps: should we go for equal opportunity? should we abandon it and pursue something else?

- The Fishkin and Rawls readings both push the envelope in terms of what equal opportunity should mean. But Rawls actually pushes further.
	- Fishkin pushes for a lot of changes to the rules, but still thinks we should push for "fair" rules.
	- Rawls: equal opportunity is very important, but not enough. We have to push for both equal opportunity and substantive justice.
# Rawls Reading
- The question of justice is the question of the basic structure of society and its effect on people. Kind of a big deal! Liberals think of society as invisible within the realm of justice, and tend to focus on specific wrongs. It's really important that he looks at the structure of society as the main article of justice!
- He is most famous for saying something with social contracts and a "veil of ignorance" - FORGET ABOUT IT
- The metric - what do we distribute between people? *The primary goods*! "anything of value that any rational man would want." These different things fall into different boxes:
	- Fundamental liberties - freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, etc
	- Opportunities
	- Wealth and income
### Rawls's principles of justice - how should we design society?
1. Maximal basic liberties *for all*. - tracks to fundamental liberties
2. Inequalities must be:
	1. For the benefit of all - implemented via the difference principle - tracks to wealth and income
	2. Attached to offices and positions equally open to all - tracks to opportunities; this one is just the basic idea we have about equal opportunity as fairness

These are in order of priority. If #1 conflicts with #2a or #2b, pick #1. If #2a conflicts with #2b, pick #2a.

The Rawls table represents three positions that are available under liberalism:
Natural Liberty
Liberal Equality
Democratic Equality

There's also utilitarianism, but Rawls hates it.

- Natural Liberty: the sophisticated libertarian position.
	- "Careers open for talent" - no discrimination or caste across any axis. It's a relatively barebones but workable idea of equal opportunity. It's the "weak" equal opportunity we discussed in the beginning.
		- The problem: it ignores how circumstances shape the opportunities you have. It doesn't account for contingencies in life and nature that give some people more arbitrary access to the good things in life than others.
	- Pareto efficiency - inequalities are justified when there's no way of getting rid of them without hurting at least one party. It's an (inadequate) response to the fact that society has a design that gives some parties an unfair advantage over others.
- Liberal Equality:
	- "Equality of fair opportunity" - push harder on equal opportunity. Control for every extraneous factor that could impact your outcome. Like asking if you took an LSAT prep course when applying to law school. "We're going to weed out anything that irrelevant and shouldn't contribute to outcome." What's left? Effort and talent! **A meritocracy!**
		- What's the problem?
		- Atkinson: we shouldn't abandon people just because they fail.
		- There's no moral basis for distributing wealth based on talent. It's just as arbitrary as distributing it based on birthright.
			- Your talent is mostly a product of two factors that you cannot be responsible for because they're outside of your control: your circumstances, and your genetics! 
			- Even effort is largely a product of circumstances beyond your control - did you need to have a job back when you were in high school? did your parents in still good work ethic in you?
			- For these reasons, Fishkin talks so much about the family. If we're sticking with Rawls, controlling the family might be violating the basic liberties principle...
	- Pareto efficiency
- Democratic Equality:
	- "Equality of fair opportunity"
	- "Difference principle" - an alternative to Kaldor-Hicks or Pareto efficiency. Give absolute priority to the worse off. Situation B is more efficient than situation A if and only if the individual that's worst off is better off. AKA maxi-min.
		- Ex: in situation A, Evan has 10 apples and Daniel has 3 apples. In situation B, Evan has 4 apples and Daniel has 5. Situation B is still more efficient.
			- In Situation A, the worst off person has 3 apples. In situation B, the worst off person has 4 apples. So situation B is more efficient.

- Economic efficiency: Situation B is more efficient than situation A if it leads to a greater total of goods. Situation B is more efficient than situation A if whatever the winners win in B is greater than what the losers lose.
	- When is it better for Evan to have 9 goods rather than 10 goods? When the total sum of goods across society is greater when Evan has 9. 
	- This is classical efficiency, or Kaldor-Hicks.
- Pareto efficiency - Situation B is more efficient than situation A if there is at least one winner and no losers.
	- Pareto efficiency is attractive because it prioritizes situations with no losers. It is incredibly difficult to object to! You can put it in so many different terms: there's no harm, there's no injury, there's no waste.
- One way to justify Kaldor-Hicks: *potential Pareto*. If the winners gain more than the losers lose, it's possible for the winners to right the wrong by compensating the losers. But in practice... . they don't have to do that in order for an outcome to be Kaldor-Hicks efficient.



- Whatever you do, even if you put aside all the other problems with equal opportunity and manage to completely control and equalize for circumstances, there is a question of whether the outcomes of a fair race are substantialy worthwhile:
	- Imagine two equally fair races.
		- In one race, first place gets $10m, second place gets $5m, and third place gets $1m.
		- In another race, first place gets $10m, second place gets $5m, everyone else gets shot.

# Fishkin Reading
- he dgaaaf about crossing the rubicon of equality of opportunity.
- His idea - it's not about making the race as fair / equal as possible, it's about the pathways to success. We need to have as many pathways to success as possible.
- What he cares about is not just equality - it's plurality!
- It doesn't solve the limitations of equal opportunity - Rawls actually tackles that in a way that Fishkin doesn't. But it highlights a different dimension of equality that we rarely talk about.
