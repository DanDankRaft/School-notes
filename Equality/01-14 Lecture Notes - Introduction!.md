# Syllabus and Technicalities
- Check out canvas on a regular basis. Everything's on there.
## Discussion Boards
- REQUIRED!
- On Canvas
- Bracha will create one for each week, and we have to post at least: 
- Requirements:
	- 7 posts
	- 5 comments on other students' posts.
-  By 8PM of the day prior to our lecture.
- There are a total of 10 meetings that will have such discussion boards!
## Research Paper
- Substantial research paper
	- Related to what we talked about in class
- 30+ pages - "soft requirement"
- This class is a combination of theory - political philosophy and what it means, and application - to real life, real institutions, real legal implications. Our papers are expected to demonstrate this combination. Don't escape to one of the extremes!
- Keep in mind all the hard deadlines in this course
	- Confirm your topic by March 13th
	- Submit an outline and a short prospectus by March 29th
	- Individual meeting during the week of March 30th
	- Oral presentation - sometime during the last five weeks. We will lead a mini-lecture (including readings) about our topic
## Structure of the course
- first seven weeks - mostly introduction to the political philosophy of equality
- next few weeks - mostly studying equality and inequality in real world cases and institutions.
- week 11 - no lecture! individual meetings.
- last three weeks - student presentations.

# What is Equality
- This is about Equality - in modern, liberal political philosophy.
- Equality can mean different things.
- Political equality v. economic equality v. social equality
- Today's readings are focused on *distributive justice* or *distributive equality* - how to justly distribute the good things in life across society.
- There will always be competing claims for the same resources. It can be complicated to argue over 
## Bread hypo
- we are all stranded on an island. but we get one loaf of bread a day. How do we distribute it?
- Distribute it equally! Why?
	- **Equal Concern** - we start from the idea that we care about each human life equally.
- One person has some physiological condition that gets his body less calories from the same quantity of bread. Should we give that person more bread?
	- **Need** - different people have different needs. Do we account for that when we distribute resources? How much?
- What if the thing that materializes is the ingredients to make bread, and only some people are involved in baking the bread every day?
	- **Deserving** - maybe some people can claim that they *deserve* more or less of the resource than others. 
- What if we are all toiling and baking the bread, but Catherine is so much more skillful at baking bread, and ends up creating more bread than everyone else despite doing the same amount of work?

- Secondary considerations - administrability of resources, measurements, etc.

## Research and Development Hypo
- We have limited funds to contribute to pharmaceutical research:
	- Project 1 - 10,000 people willing and able to spend $20m to help develop this project. Its a *lifestyle* drug, not necessary for survival.
	- Project 2 - 100,000 people willing and able to spend $11m. A cure for a really horrible, life-threatening disease. People with this disease tend to be poorer.
- Which project is more likely to get funded IRL? Project 1. The free market incentivizes this, via *property rights*. If you develop it, you get a patent! And the patent for project 1 is worth more money.
	- Pharma companies have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to maximize profits. Project 1 creates more profit!
- Which project *should* get funded?
	- Utilitarian POV - Project 2. It has more utility
	- Economic Efficiency POV - Project 1. More willingness from the market to pay for this!
	- Economic Externalities POV - Project 2. The people cured by this project can probably work harder and contribute more to the economy.
- **Economic Efficiency** - we should maximize market value in society - which is measured by willingness and ability to pay.
	- Pareto efficiency - Situation A is better than Situation B if nobody is worse off and at least one person is better off
	- Kaldor-Hicks efficiency - Situation A is better than Situation B if the group that loses out suffers less than the group that wins out? Not sure.
- **Externalities** - indirect economic outcomes of a decision.
> [!important] There are circumstances where one outcome will be picked by the market because its more efficient, but where another outcome will have better externalities.

- Beyond economics: 
	- What if we believe that we can't directly compare the happiness of many people to saving one human life?
	- What if we come from an unequal society where the amount that people pay is not just influenced by willingness, but their means?

### Takeaways
- In our society, a lot of our social decisions are governed by the market. Markets can frequently conflict with our normative decisions
- The decisions that create inequality and the decisions that inequality creates are not made by individuals, they are made by large societal groups.

# Readings
- Atkinson died in 2017. He's one of the founders of the field of the economics of inequality and poverty. A lot of what he did is justify why his field matters.
- Piketty is alive and French. He became famous in 2011 by writing *Capital in the 21st Century*. His main point - economics *should* be about equality and inequality. But he follows much more traditional, empirical methods than Piketty.
- Dworkin - legal and political philosopher. Bracha - most important legal philosopher of the 20th century. *Sovereign Virtue* is his main work on equality.
## Piketty's Brief History of Equality
- A broad outlook both in geography and in time period.
- Relatively optimistic story about how inequality is going down over time.
- Main driver of equality is the interaction between two things:
	- Political will and power. Those who want to see more equality need to have the political power to push for it. Including, but not limited to major social conflicts and events.
	- Understanding what framework of equality we're pushing for. What is equality? What is the type of equality we're trying to advocate for? It's also about **institutional design - including the law.**
		- The focus of this seminar is moreso about institutional design, and less about the politics. How do we take abstract ideas about equality and justice and put them into design?

> [!info] If you look at a graph of any measure of inequality from the end of the 19th century to the present, it looks like a U-curve. It is high in the beginning, then dips at roughly the 1950s, then rises starts rising back up in the 1970s or 1980s to the present.
- Then, why does Piketty say that even for 1980-2020, inequality has gone down?
	- One explanation: China, South Korea, Eastern Europe industrializing and catching up with the west. *international* inequality is declining in a way that's rapidly dwarfing any inequality within any country.
	- Another explanation: "if we adopt a multidimensional perspective;" - inequality across genders, sexualities, racial groups, etc has all declined. **Formal inequality** and **equality of status** has declined. This is mainly about legal discrimination - deprivation of voting rights, legal caste systems, etc. The U-shape graphs don't really capture that. But Bracha also wants to clarify that formal equality and equality of status is not the focus of this seminar.
		- Bracha thinks the US doesn't care enough about distributive inequality, and cares more about
- Piketty also says that there's a strong relationship between formal and informal inequality. If you want to tackle one, you have to tackle the other.
### Explaining the U curve
- Late 19th, early 20th centuries - classical liberal / lassies-faire policy dominates in the US.
- 1930s - great depression leads to the creation of the New Deal / welfare state / social democracy.
- 1970s + 1980s - turn to neoliberalism, dismantling of the New Deal project.
- Where are we right now? Are we sticking with neoliberalism? Are we returning to social democracy? Are we creating something else? *Nobody knows.*

- Conclusion: the U-curve is the result of legal and institutional design. Distributive economic policy!
	- Atkinson is quite clear about this - the welfare state, social security, labor law, corporate regulation.
	- Dworkin says this on page 1 - "For the distribution of wealth is the product of a legal order."
		- He doesn't say that there is a "natural baseline" where things are perfectly equal. He says that there is no such thing as a "natural baseline" for the way in which we structure human society.
## Dworkin's Sovereign Virtue
- Explaining the book name:
	- The sovereign is us - we are the political community.
	- Equality is the most important public social value
- Why is equality the most important public value?
	- It's not a private value. It's fine for us to not treat everyone equally in our private life.
	- He's a full believer in Equal Concern - he's the one who coined the term.
		- He believes that this is the foundational axiom of political liberalism. Everything else springs from it.
		- This is what "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite" is about!!
			- Egalite = egalitarianism, equality.
			- Fraternite is about how we have a public duty to care for each other.
- The book is written in 2000 - he's directly responding to Third Way / New Labour. He's asking - how did we get here? Why did the left abandon equality?
	- His theory - old egalitarians made a mistake. "the strange idea of sameness from cradle to grave." If that's the value we're pushing for, government's job is to continuously take resources away from hard working people who make money and give it to people who put in less effort.
		- Why is this wrong? It doesn't factor in personal responsibility.
- The two main pillars of liberalism are:
	- Equal concern; and
	- Personal responsibility.
- "Old egalitarians" failed because they focused too much on equality of outcome, which completely ignores personal responsibility.
- Another value of liberalism: **Equal Respect.** Each person gets to decide what their life wants to look like. They get to make the choices. But they're still accountable for their own choices.
- In the west, old egalitarians let people choose their own life but did not know how to old people accountable for their own choices.
- In the Soviet Union, old egalitarians decided that they will push equal respect aside, sidestepping personal responsibility by making the choices for you.
### Criticisms of Equality
- Hayek - it's hard to push for distributive equality too much without leading to "totalitarianism."
- Roberts - equality is unfair. Equality requires you to constantly take from some and give to others, even when they did nothing wrong.
### Next week:
- If equality means distributive justice, what are we distributing?
- What is just redistribution? How do you take into account people's needs, and what they deserve?
