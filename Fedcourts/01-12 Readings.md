# Constitution, Articles III and VI
* Federal courts only have jurisdiction as authorized by statute, and only insofar as those statutes respect limitations of Article III
* Most important statute - federal question; 28 USC 1331
## Article III
> **Section 1**
> The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.
> 
> **Section 2**
> The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.
> 
> In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. ==In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.==
> 
> The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

Section 1 - judicial power is vested on SCOTUS, and inferior courts which Congress may choose to establish
Section 2 - list of all cases where federal courts may have jurisdiction:
* cases in Law and Equity arising under the Constitution
* US laws
* US treaties
* Cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls
* all maritime cases
* cases where the US is a party
* uhh basically all cases where at least two states are involved or the citizens of at least two different states are involved

## Article IV, Section 2 (The Supremacy Clause)
> This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

SCOTUS original jurisdiction comes from the constitution
SCOTUS appellate jurisdiction only exists insofar as Congress authorizes it via statute. This is a matter of convention that SCOTUS just never challenged
Lower federal courts have never been granted the entire judicial power outlined in Article III

*Marbury v. Madison* - while Congress may limit which cases a court can hear, it cannot force courts to decide on a case inconsistently with the Constitution.

## Congressional Authority over State and Federal Court Jurisdiction
* Congress has the power to limit the appellate jurisdiction of SCOTUS
	* Scholars disagree on how much power Congress has to do this. Some say this doesn't apply to its "essential role," whatever that means.
* But it doesn't have the power to prevent state courts from reviewing constitutional questions - due to Supremacy Clause.
* The result? Theoretically, state courts could become the supreme authority of constitutional law in the United States. This is called *The Traditional View*
* In practice, Congress doesn't do this because it would create massive inconsistencies across the US.

* Congress has the power to take away trial jurisdiction from state courts over some federal statutory questions. Ex: 18 USC 1338 - giving federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over patent and copyright cases.
* The Constitution prevents state courts from having original jurisdiction on some narrow issues where the federal government is the defendant. eg, habeas corpus challenges.

# *Ex parte McCardle*
SCOTUS, 1868. 74 US 506
### Facts and Background
* In 1867, Congress passed a law granting federal courts jurisdiction over writs of habeas corpus over people in state custody. It also gave SCOTUS jurisdiction to hear appeals over such writs.
	* Something to do with reconstruction in the south
* In 1868 (before this case), Congress repealed this statute.

## Governing law
Article III, Section 2, paragraph 2:
> In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

### Question
Does SCOTUS have jurisdiction over this guy's appeal?
### Holding
* No.
* The affirmation of appellate jurisdiction \[by congress\] implies the negation of all such jurisdiction not affirmed
* This act was repealed, this jurisdiction is no longer affirmed. It is negated!
* Petitioner cites several state cases. But they have no jurisdiction here. "They are all cases of the exercise of judicial power by the legislature, or of legislative interference with courts in the exercising of continuing jurisdiction." What does this mean?
* BUT, petitioner can still bring his case before SCOTUS if appealed from circuit courts.
	* Historical context: court was under attack from Congress during reconstruction. Did not want to anger Congress on the merits
	* The point of this decision is to give Congress what it wants on the merits without giving up on power to hear cases.

# Problem 1
* CA law requires students to recite pledge of allegiance
* Potter family sues in federal court as a violation of the Establishment Clause
* They prepare to appeal case to SCOTUS, but new law says:
>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by writ of certiorari, appeal, or otherwise, any judgment adjudicating a claim pertaining to the interpretation of, or the validity under the U.S. Constitution of, the Pledge of Allegiance or its recitation.

* Q: Can SCOTUS hear this case?
	* McCardle explicitly does not apply to appeals from circuit courts
		* But... that authority still comes from a statute. And Congress just passed a new statute that overrides that appellate jurisdiction
	* We know that preventing SCOTUS from hearing constitutional cases is really bad for the country, this may be one of those "essential functions"
		* But... state courts are still around and they still have ultimate jurisdiction over this kinda stuff.
