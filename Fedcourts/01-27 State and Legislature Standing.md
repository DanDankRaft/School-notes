# Raines v. Byrd
521 U.S. 881 (1997)
## Background
+ Congress passed a bill giving the president a line item veto
+ One of the provisions in the bill allows individuals members of congress to sue in the federal courts over the constitutionality of this bill.
+ Plaintiffs are several members of congress, all opposing this bill, who brought this action before SCOTUS
## Question
- Do members of Congress have a concrete injury when a law deprives them of some powers?
## Holding (Rehnquist)
- Not really.
- Distinguishing from *Coleman* (a case where state legislatures sued bc they thought some tie-breaker was unconstitutional):
	- In *Coleman*, the votes of the individual legislators were effectively nullified. They suffered a personal injury.
	- Something weird here - they say that the legislators only had standing in *Coleman* bc they were right on the merits.
	- Here, the plaintiffs merely allege that the law makes their future votes in Congress less effective. That's not the same thing!
## Souter concurrence
- This is about separation of powers. It'd be better if we got to be more impartial by having some private party bring this claim to us.
## Dissents
- Stevens - this is a constitutional right towards individuals (the legislators) that's being violated!
- Breyer:
	- This is not distinguishable from *Coleman*
	- The jurisdictional statute limits us to only constitutional considerations here!
	- "The constitution does not draw an absolute line between disputes involving a 'personal' harm and those involving an 'official' harm"

# Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Ind. Redistricting Commission
576 U.S. 787 (2015)
## Background
- Arizona voters passed a referendum creating an independent redistricting commission.
- The legislature **as an institution** sued, saying that they reserved this right under the Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1).
### Legal Question
- Is this distinguishable from *Raines*? If so, how?
## Holding
- YES. This party has standing.
- One reason - they're an institutional plaintiff representing legislature as a whole, not just individual legislators.
- Another reason - this is analogous to *Coleman*: an act nullifying the votes of the vote of legislators.
- Dissent - court should not involve itself in disputes between legislature and executive of the same government.
- Another possibility - SCOTUS is more reluctant to get involved in state government disputes.
# Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill
587 U.S. ___ (2019)
## Background
- Voters sued Virginia's executive branch after the legislature drew new state house maps, for being a racial gerrymander.
- After losing in a lower court, the state AG announced that he would not appeal the case further. The Virginia House of Delegates then petitioned it themselves.
## Legal Question
- Can they do that? Appeal a case where they're injured by a decision but were not a party?
- Do they have standing
## Holding
- NO. They cannot appeal
- Under VA's constitution, they don't have the authority to represent the state here.
- We never held that a judicial decision invalidating a state law as unconstitutional inflicts a discrete, cognizable injury on each organ of government that participated in the law's passage.
- Distinguishing from *Coleman* and *Arizona State Legislature* - the house is suing by itself. This isn't the house and senate acting together. So it's not the state legislature as a whole who is suing over losing some power!
	- WAIT - but it wasn't the legislature as a whole in *Coleman* either.
## Dissent
- The house is suffering a concrete injury bc it has a vested interest on how its own members get selected
	- Majority - but the whole point of a legislature is that they don't get to choose how they get selected!
- The majority is too concerned with applying federal separation-of-powers principles to a state government over which they lack jurisdiction.

# State Government Standing
- *Massachussets v. EPA* (2007) - state has standing over law that would've preempted them from setting emission standards: state is a coastal landowner, and has a "quasi-sovereign interest" so it could protect on behalf of its residents
- Texas v. United States (5th Cir. 2015) - state has standing over law that impacts driver license eligibility bc state issues and subsidizes the driver's licenses. Upheld by SCOTUS without an opinion bc of the 4-4 split.
- Department of Commerce v. New York - federal directive requiring citizenship question on census. states suing had standing bc it could impact reporting rate and thus affect their eligibility for federal prgorams. This is not "speculation" on the basis of third party conduct bc its the "predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties."
# California v. Texas
593 U.S. __ (2021)
## Background
- After *Sebelius*, SCOTUS maintained constitutionality of ACA's individual mandate via the taxing power. Congress then reduced the individual mandate tax to $0. Texas sued, arguing that the reporting requirements of the ACA imposed a financial injury on them, and were now unconstitutional bc they came from neither the commerce nor taxing power.
- Majority argued there was no standing. Dissent argued that there was standing bc the plaintiffs argued that the statute's provisions were inseverable.
# More Recent Decisions
### Haaland v. Brackeen
599 U.S. __ (2023)
- Texas challenged Indian Child Welfare Act on equal protection wrt child adoption policies.
- Standing denied, bc the state does not have equal protection rights - its the parents. They're the ones suffering this injury.
### Biden v. Nebraska
600 U.S. (2023)
- SCOTUS case challenging Biden's student loan relief program in 2023.
- Missouri had standing bc it had a state agency (MOHELA) that received federal spending based on the number of accounts it administered. Biden's action would've directly reduced the number of accounts.
- Dissent: MOHELA would've had standing, but Missouri is merely suing bc of an ideological injury.
### United States v. Texas
599 U.S. ___ (2023)
- Texas alleged an injury due to lack of enforcement of immigration policy (not arresting unauthorized immigrants). 
- SCOTUS - there is no cognizable injury here according with history and tradition. In fact, we have precedent that no party has a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution of another.
- Thomas concurrence - no redressability. Statute prevents us from granting any relief that would help plaintiffs.

- Conclusion: courts are no longer treating states as special plaintiffs a la *Massachusetts v. EPA*. Unclear whether it's still good law!
