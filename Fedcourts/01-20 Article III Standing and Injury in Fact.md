# Review from Last Class - SCOTUS Reform
- Prevailing questions on SCOTUS reform:
	- Can you do it?
	- Would it be a good idea? Does it have good policy implications? Does it achieve its goals?
- Congress can regulate the ethics of the federal judiciary - per N&P clause + Article III Good Behavior Clause.
- Even for lower federal courts, people worry about enforcement. Bc it's done by other federal judges. How much are federal judges willing to police their own?
- Alternatively, they can be impeached. But impeachment for federal judges requires treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanor. Not done without criminal conduct.
- Court packing by Congress - fully allowed!
	- Court expansion is a way to change its jurisprudence quickly!
	- But, of course, extremely controversial. Would really undermine the court's legitimacy!
- Term limits for judges - incl. both lower and higher
	- Very popular
	- Throughout most of American history, consensus was that it'd require a constitutional amendment.
	- There's no consensus on it nowadays.
	- This has very low chance of passing. Guess who's going to review whether its constitutional?
	- This is a very long term change. Would take a very long time to affect jurisprudence.
- Jurisdiction stripping
	- Typically constitutional
	- But very big problem - if SCOTUS made a ruling you didn't like, and then you strip their jurisdiction over it, you're now stuck!

# Intro to Article III Standing
> [!info] Three Requirements for Article III Standing
> 1. Plaintiff suffered **injury-in-fact**:
>    concrete
>    particularized
>    imminent
> 2. Injury **caused by** the defendant
> 3. **Redressability** via damages or injunctive relief by the court

- Professor A wacks Student B with a book in class. Student C witnesses this. Does Student C have an injury-in-fact? What about other students in the class?
	- Maybe!
	- Emotional distress
	- Fear of future harm
	- Need to take precautions
- Do other students in UT - who don't take Professor A's class?
	- There are some other arguments for this, but they feel weaker.
	- The affirmative argument for standing for any UT student in campus: anyone the professor interacts with is now in danger!
- Woman in Maine sees report about this incident happening in TV and is incensed with this. Can she sue the professor?
	- Probably not. It's no longer **concrete or particularized** to any one plaintiff.

- Takeaway: standing is complicated. Most people have an intuitive sense for cases on the extremes. But there's a huge gray area that's subject to intense debate.
# *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife*
504 U.S. 555 (1992)
## Background
- Endangered Species Act has provision requiring federal agencies to ensure that none of their actions jeopardize the existence of endangered species.
- In 1986, Department of the Interior published a memo loosening audit requirements in situations where foreign nations engage in endangering behaviors. Plaintiffs sue, arguing this violates ESA.
- Plaintiffs are two tourists who had visited foreign countries in the past to observe endangered species, and desire to return in the future but have no concrete plans.
	- **Claimed injury:** These are people who want to travel and see  endangered species, but are worried that they won't be able to do so in the future.

- Lower court rejected summary judgement for defendants.
## Question
- Is the tourists' interest in viewing the species one that can be injured?
- Did the parties actually suffer an injury in fact?
- Does the "citizen-suit" provision of the ESA allow anyone to claim that they suffer an injury when the ESA is violated?
## Three requirements for standing
1. Injury in fact - (a) concrete and particularized, (b) actual or imminent, not hypothetical
2. Causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of
3. Injury must be "likely" to be "redressed by a favorable decision," not merely "speculative"
## Majority Holding (Scalia)
- No standing!
- **Aesthetic injury:** The plaintiff's claimed injury is aesthetic - viewing a species. This is actually allowed!
	- viewing species - valid interest.
	- viewing nature - valid interest.
- **Occupational interest** in species - allowed!
> [!info] Lujan also says that you have a legitimate interest in viewing a species. That sounds like emotional harm!

- Typical standing: Plaintiffs have no case here bc their plans to return to Sri Lanka and Egypt are merely speculative. They want to return eventually... some day.... but have no plans.
	- **Not imminent**
- Procedural Injury / citizen-suit standing: also no!
	> "any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf (A) to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency ... who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter"
	
	- While Congress can create new legal injuries (ex: by saying that anyone suing the government on this issue and winning will receive a bounty), **it cannot merely create a standing for anyone**.
		- Congress cannot create an abstract, generalized grievance.
		- At this point, all the plaintiffs are complaining about is that the government didn't follow this statutory requirement. Not that this somehow injured them.
		- It's not **particularized?**
	- This would be a violation of separation of powers!
		- Marbury: "The province of the court is solely to decide on the rights of individuals" - IE, not public interests!
		- It would take executive branch's power to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," turning the courts into a political monitor over the executive branch.
	- "Special interest" in an area of law - not valid injury for standing (also applies to *Schlesinger*).

- Footnote about procedural harms: when Congress creates a procedural right, you can be injured by having a procedural right violated. But you still have to suffer a **particularized** injury.
	- Ex: you're supposed to have a statutory right during a license application process. You can sue if govt doesn't follow the procedure that affords you that right.
## Concurrences
+ Kennedy + Souter: When Congress creates a new injury, it must "at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit"
+ Stevens: Plaintiffs introduced enough evidence to demonstrate that they'll visit in the future, so it's not "speculative," but they failed to demonstrate that they'll study or observe the animals.
## Dissent
- This is an attack on separation of powers, taking power away from Congress and giving it to the executive!
- Congress often legislates by setting forth substantive policy goals and requiring the executive to follow certain procedures in order to achieve these goals.
- Taking away "procedural injury" in this case prevents Congress from making sure that the executive actually follows their intent!
- TL;DR - injury requirement is fact specific, but we should defer to Congress whenever possible.
# *Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War*
418 U.S. 208 (1974)
- Plaintiffs were ideologically opposed to Vietnam war, and sued to prevent members of Congress from simultaneously having military commissions (they argued it's a violation of the Incompatibility Clause: Article I, Section 6, Clause 2)
- Non-injury asserted: ideological disagreement 
- Holding:
	- Ideological objection to a law is not standing
	- Merely opposing some government action is not standing
	- Standing is especially important in constitutional cases bc it prevents the courts from using their power unnecessarily.
	- If you can't sue for a violation of a right, go to the legislature
> [!info] Standing doctrine is about policing the line between what should go to the legislature vs the courts

# Problem 4
- Chicago has an ordinance that makes it very difficult to acquire a gun. It may be in violation of recent 2nd amendment doctrine from SCOTUS.
- Dirty Harry (California) and Yosemite Sam (Texas) want to challenge this law for violating second amendment.
- Sam cannot own guns bc he 
- Congress passed a statute:
> Any person who owns a firearm, or who has a special interest in protecting the rights of gun ownership, is harmed by any violation of the constitutional right to bear arms, and may commence a civil suit on his own behalf to enjoin any person, including any governmental instrumentality or agency at the local, state, or federal level, who is alleged to be in violation of any right guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.
