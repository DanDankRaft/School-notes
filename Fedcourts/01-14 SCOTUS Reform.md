 - [ ] Handout: Final Report: Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court
 - [ ] Problem 3

# Review from Last Class
- There are very few cases on congressional power to limit jurisdiction. Very few bills about these pass, and when they come before SCOTUS, it tends to interpret them as narrowly as possible.
- One view: plenary power. Congress creates the lower courts so it can choose their jurisdiction. And the Exceptions clause lets it control the jurisdiction of the supreme court.
- Another view: "The Judicial Power shall be vested.... " - at least one federal court must have the power to hear federal law questions, or at least
- One view of *McCardle* - Congress must leave at least one avenue for SCOTUS to hear a case.
	- This ties with the Essential Functions theory.
- One view of *Klein* - Congress can never tell the court how to rule on a case. But very difficult to square with what has happened throughout the past 100 years.
- Another view of *Klein* - Congress has the power to amend the law. Congress just can't tell federal courts to decide cases in a way that would be unconstitutional. That turns each individual law into a question of whether the underlying law is constitutional.
- Due Process Clause (5th Amendment) - at least some court in the nation must be able to hear each case. If there's a claim that no court can hear, that may be a violation of the due process clause.

# History of Supreme Court reform
- Attacks on SCOTUS independence are as old as SCOTUS itself.
- Most famous attempt - FDR 1936 court packing plan.
- Attacks on SCOTUS slowed down during the Warren court, but conservatives have started hating SCOTUS a lot more.
- The pendulum swung again around the turn of the century. Major flashpoint - Merrick Garland and Amy Comey Barrett nominations.
# Prof's experience being on the Biden Supreme Court Reform Commission
- Surprising dedication by everyone to follow the law as much as possible.
- Lawyers actually care about the law and following it.
- Why does the report not actually recommend anything?
	- Executive order that created the commission specifically asked not to give recommendations, just an analysis
	- Also, there was a ton of disagreement between all the commissioners.
# SCOTUS Ethics Code	  
> [!info] SCOTUS does not have a code of judicial ethics. It's unclear whether Congress can create one. But everyone agrees that it would be nice if it had one.
- In 1980, Congress imposed a stringent ethics code on the rest of the federal judiciary. But it's an open question as to whether Congress can create one for SCOTUS.
- Can you use the Exceptions clause to create ethics regulations on SCOTUS justices?
	- Probably not. It specifically refers to
- What does the existing ethics code rely on? 
	- Necessary and Proper clause - can also be used to effectuate the enforcement of the entire constitution, not just Congress's powers.
	- Combined with Article III's Good Behavior clause.
- Can you use this logic to create an ethics code for SCOTUS? Congress debated this once, and shot this down for a couple of reasons:
	- It would infringe on the separation of powers between the branches. Congressional queasiness is a strong argument 
	- We already have impeachment.
- Impeachment for justices also requires "treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors."
	- There's a norm that lower federal judges can only be impeached if they committed an actual crime. This is NOT the norm for presidents.
	- Since 1935, impeachment trials of lower judges are held before a commission, which then presents the evidence to the whole senate for the vote.
# Textbook
* There has been a lot of historical back and forth on the size of the court, and it's always been partisan and politically motivated..
* List of examples:
	* Outgoing Federalist Congress v. incoming president Jefferson
	* Republicans during the civil war and reconstruction
	* FDR's 1936 plan
* Since the end of reconstruction, these efforts  have been stymied due to internal disagreement on protecting the independence of the judiciary.
# Biden's Court Packing Commission
## Arguments for Expansion
1. Response to Republican Senators violating norms (see Garland and Barrett nominations) in order to pack the courts themselves and make them more partisan
2. Preventing erosion of democracy by a partisan and irresponsible court.
3. A larger court would be stronger - more diverse, decides more cases, more trusted by the public.
## Arguments Against Expansion
1. Undermines judicial independence - not just by letting Congress stack the court with favorable justices, but by making existing justices more sensitive to partisan needs.
2. Undermining the court's legitimacy - if the court was packed, it could be seen as a partisan move that erodes public trust in the court's decisions. That's dangerous. If the public doesn't view SCOTUS decisions as authoritative, it makes it easier for the executive to just ignore them.
3. Democracy - the vast majority of the public opposes court packing

## Proposal of Junior/Senior Justice System
* After 18 years of service, justices are promoted to senior justices, who no longer take on the traditional duties of a SCOTUS justice, but do other things instead, like riding circuit. Seems quite constitutional.
* Constitutional challenges:
	* Good Behavior Clause. Article III, Section 1. May be read to entitle SCOTUS justices to life tenure.
	* Appointments Clause. Article II, Section 2.
	* These clauses are there to protect judicial independence!
	* Relevant here: *Booth v. United States* - senior judges on lower courts remained in office as judges for Article III matters.
	* Also something about Compensation Clause of Article III
## Jurisdiction-Stripping Proposals
- Jurisdiction-stripping effectively gives Congress the power to determine that a covered statute is constitutionally valid.
	- Less separation of powers
	- But more democratic accountability - Congress is elected!
- Jurisdiction-stripping would lead to less uniformity.
- It could also lead, in some cases, to some lower court having the final say on a nationwide issue.
	- Ex: a circuit court upholding a nationwide injunction.
	- Ex: any federal circuit case.
- It would lead constitutional rights to be held solely at the mercy of Congress.
- It could contribute to partisan polarization and institutional instability - each incoming congress insulating more and more laws in a tug-of-war.

# Problem 3
- Three statutes for supreme court reform, geared at overturning a SCOTUS decision that said the pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional.
> [!info] The most common impetus for SCOTUS reform is "how do we get rid of this bad decision"

> (1) The Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by writ of certiorari, appeal, or otherwise, any judgment adjudicating a claim pertaining to the validity under the U.S. Constitution of the Pledge of  Allegiance or its recitation.
> (2) The Supreme Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and twelve associate justices, eight of whom shall constitute a quorum.
> (3) The President shall, during the first and third years after a year in which there is a presidential election, nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint one Justice of the Supreme Court.
> 	a. The panel of justices exercising Judicial power in Cases and Controversies shall compromise the nine most junior Justices
> 	b. After a justice has served 18 years, that justice shall be deemed a Justice retired from regular active service.
