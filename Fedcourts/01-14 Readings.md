 - [ ] Problem 3

# Textbook
* There has been a lot of historical back and forth on the size of the court, and it's always been partisan and politically motivated..
* List of examples:
	* Outgoing Federalist Congress v. incoming president Jefferson
	* Republicans during the civil war and reconstruction
	* FDR's 1936 plan
* Since the end of reconstruction, these efforts  have been stymied due to internal disagreement on protecting the independence of the judiciary.
# Biden's Court Packing Commission
## Arguments for Expansion
1. Response to Republican Senators violating norms (see Garland and Barrett nominations) in order to pack the courts themselves and make them more partisan
2. Preventing erosion of democracy by a partisan and irresponsible court.
3. A larger court would be stronger - more diverse, decides more cases, more trusted by the public.
## Arguments Against Expansion
1. Undermines judicial independence - not just by letting Congress stack the court with favorable justices, but by making existing justices more sensitive to partisan needs.
2. Undermining the court's legitimacy - if the court was packed, it could be seen as a partisan move that erodes public trust in the court's decisions. That's dangerous. If the public doesn't view SCOTUS decisions as authoritative, it makes it easier for the executive to just ignore them.
3. Democracy - the vast majority of the public opposes court packing

## Proposal of Junior/Senior Justice System
* After 18 years of service, justices are promoted to senior justices, who no longer take on the traditional duties of a SCOTUS justice, but do other things instead, like riding circuit. Seems quite constitutional.
* Constitutional challenges:
	* Good Behavior Clause. Article III, Section 1. May be read to entitle SCOTUS justices to life tenure.
	* Appointments Clause. Article II, Section 2.
	* These clauses are there to protect judicial independence!
	* Relevant here: *Booth v. United States* - senior judges on lower courts remained in office as judges for Article III matters.
	* Also something about Compensation Clause of Article III
## Jurisdiction-Stripping Proposals
- Jurisdiction-stripping effectively gives Congress the power to determine that a covered statute is constitutionally valid.
	- Less separation of powers
	- But more democratic accountability - Congress is elected!
- Jurisdiction-stripping would lead to less uniformity.
- It could also lead, in some cases, to some lower court having the final say on a nationwide issue.
	- Ex: a circuit court upholding a nationwide injunction.
	- Ex: any federal circuit case.
- It would lead constitutional rights to be held solely at the mercy of Congress.
- It could contribute to partisan polarization and institutional instability - each incoming congress insulating more and more laws in a tug-of-war.
