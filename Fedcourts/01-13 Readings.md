## Sheldon v. Sill
* Congress has effectively unlimited authority to control the jurisdiction of the lower courts, so
## Webster v. Doe
* statute gives director of CIA the power to fire anyone for any reason. Plaintiff is fired for being gay.
* Question: does this statute preclude lower courts from reviewing constitutional claims on this matter?
* Answer: no, unless Congress makes it clear.
* Dissents: it's untenable that every constitutional violation has a judicial remedy. it's untenable here.

* There are disagreements on whether Congress can completely deny jurisdiction to the lower courts over some issues.
	* what about controversies not outlined in article 3?
	* what about reviewing state court decisions?
## Essential Functions Thesis
- A theory competing with the traditional view.
- There are two essential functions of SCOTUS that Congress cannot get rid of :
	- resolving conflicting interpretations of federal law
	- maintaining the supremacy of federal law - especially the constitution - over state law.
- Another theory: bc of modern caseloads, maintaining lower federal courts is also an essential function that Congress cannot get rid of entirely.

## Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co. II
* Virginia built a bridge near the PA border. PA sued the bridge and received an injunction from SCOTUS.
* Congress subsequently passed a law declaring the bridge legal
* After a storm, VA started rebuilding the bridge and PA asked for a second injunction.
* Question: can Congress overturn Article III injunctions?
* Answer: yes. kind of.
	* Typically, no. But the injunction here was an "executory, continuing decree based on the violation of a public right." Now that Congress passed this law, the public right was no longer being violated.
# United States v. Klein
## Facts and Background
* During reconstruction, govt siezed property from people loyal to Confederacy.
* In some other case, receiving a presidential pardon was found as evidence grounds to say that the person was not guilty of loyalty to Confederacy.
* P had property siezed by received pardon. Lower court granted to P.
* Inbetween lower ruling and SCOTUS hearing, Congress passed a new law saying that:
	* Pardons do not constitutite innocence in this case
	* If claimant prevailed in lower court based on pardon, SCOTUS and lower courts no longer have jurisdiction and must instead dismiss the suit.
## Question
* Is this constitutional? Is this any different from *Wheeling*?
## Answer
- This is unconstitutional!
- This statute is different bc it's simply withholding jurisdiction as a means to an end.
- Congress can't just tell a court to believe some facts and then cease having jurisdiction
- Why this is different from Wheeling:
	- In Wheeling, the new act actually changed the facts of the case.
	- Here, the new act didn't change the underlying facts. It just said you no longer have jurisdiction in this case bc we don't like the outcome you're gonna make.
- Another point: this is intruding on separation of powers. Congress can't change what a presidential pardon means!
## Bank Markazi v. Peterson
* P sued Iranian bank to seize assets in the United States. While the lawsuit was ongoing, Congress saying that P should win in cases like these, even mentioning this case by name.
* Holding: this is constitutional.
	* Doesn't matter that it was mentioned by name
	* Doesn't matter that it only applies to a very narrow class of cases
	* Does matter that it technically affects more than one case.
# Patchak v. Zinke
583 U.S. __ (2018)
## Facts
+ Govt. seized a "Bardley Property" to grant to an Indian reservation. SCOTUS affirmed that the plaintiff had standing to litigate this.
+ In the meantime, Congress passed a law saying that this action was legal and that federal courts no longer have standing to litigate this case on the merits. District court dismissed
## Question
+ Can Congress change the statutory law applicable to a pending case? Can Congress strip federal court jurisdiction over a pending case?
## Holding
+ Yes. But its a plurality opinion!
+ Conservative plurality: Congress can just do whatever
+ Liberal plurality: This is different bc this case is about sovereign immunity. What Congress did here was just retract its waiver of sovereign immunity. This has nothing to do with jurisdiction.
