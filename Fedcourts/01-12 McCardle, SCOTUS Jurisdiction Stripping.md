# Lecture Notes
* Three cases:
	* Employment discrimination. Nurse working at a state school gets demoted after battle with cancer.
		* Deciding issue: State sovereign immunity.
	* 4th amendment. Girl says her money is stolen. School strip-searches searches every boy, forces them to take off their shirts.
		* Deciding issue: qualified immunity. Government officials are immune from suit unless they break a very clear law?
	* War on terror. Taxi driver who gave a ride to Osama bin Laden gets picked up by the US and put in Gitmo. Files petition for writ of habeas corpus. While its pending, Congress passes statute saying that federal courts don't have jurisdiction over writs of habeas corpus for people in Gitmo.
		* Deciding issue: jurisdiction stripping statutes in pending cases. SCOTUS sides with plaintiff because the statute doesn't say anything in pending cases.

> [!important]
> Procedure is never just about procedure. Every case about jurisdiction/procedure involves people with real stakes in these cases!

## Major questions in this course
- What should the roles of the federal courts be?
- What should we expect of the federal judiciary given the political tasks and political backlash that they take
# Constitution, Articles III and VI
* Federal courts only have jurisdiction as authorized by statute, and only insofar as those statutes respect limitations of Article III
* Most important statute - federal question; 28 USC 1331
## Article III
> **Section 1**
> The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.
> 
> **Section 2**
> The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.
> 
> In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. ==In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.==
> 
> The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

## Article IV, Section 2 (The Supremacy Clause)
> This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

SCOTUS original jurisdiction comes from the constitution
SCOTUS appellate jurisdiction only exists insofar as Congress authorizes it via statute. This is a matter of convention that SCOTUS just never challenged
Lower federal courts have never been granted the entire judicial power outlined in Article III

*Marbury v. Madison* - while Congress may limit which cases a court can hear, it cannot force courts to decide on a case inconsistently with the Constitution.

## Congressional Authority over State and Federal Court Jurisdiction
* Congress has the power to limit the appellate jurisdiction of SCOTUS
	* Scholars disagree on how much power Congress has to do this. Some say this doesn't apply to its "essential role," whatever that means.
* But it doesn't have the power to prevent state courts from reviewing constitutional questions - due to Supremacy Clause.
* The result? Theoretically, state courts could become the supreme authority of constitutional law in the United States. This is called *The Traditional View*
* In practice, Congress doesn't do this because it would create massive inconsistencies across the US.

* Congress has the power to take away trial jurisdiction from state courts over some federal statutory questions. Ex: 18 USC 1338 - giving federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over patent and copyright cases.
* The Constitution prevents state courts from having original jurisdiction on some narrow issues where the federal government is the defendant. eg, habeas corpus challenges.

# *Ex parte McCardle*
SCOTUS, 1868. 74 US 506
### Facts and Background
* In 1867, Congress passed a law granting federal courts jurisdiction over writs of habeas corpus over people in **state custody**. It also gave SCOTUS jurisdiction to hear appeals over such writs.
	* This is about carpetbaggers. Congress is worried that they're being arrested in the South.
	* This is also about former slaves. Black Codes.
	* During reconstruction, Congress expands federal jurisdiction in tons of different ways.
* In 1868 (before this case), Congress stripped SCOTUS appellate jurisdiction over writs for habeas corpus. They make it very explicit that this is about McCardle.


- William McCardle - anti-reconstruction newspaper editor. Arrested for impeding reconstruction.
	- Advocated succession from the union very early. 
	- Threatened to publish the name of any Mississippian who voted in favor of ratifying the 14th amendment in order to make it easier to commit violence to them.
- McCardle's arguments:
	- no habeas corpus. The military doesn't have the right to do this kinda stuff!
	- first amendment challenge.
	- If this argument won, it would've undermined all of reconstruction in the US south
## Governing law
Article III, Section 2, paragraph 2:
> In all the other Cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

### Question
Does SCOTUS have jurisdiction over this guy's appeal?
### Holding
* No.
* Congress has **plenary** power to regulate SCOTUS's appellate jurisdiction. See: Exceptions clause of Article III.
	* The affirmation of appellate jurisdiction \[by congress\] implies the negation of all such jurisdiction not affirmed
	* This act was repealed, this jurisdiction is no longer affirmed. It is negated!
* BUT, SCOTUS can still hear appeals over writs of habeas corpus for people detained in federal courts.
	* In *Marbury v. Madison* - SCOTUS rules that Congress cannot expand SCOTUS's original jurisdiction. Specifically, Congress cannot give SCOTUS original jurisdiction over habeas corpus writs.
	* The point is that there are still avenues for SCOTUS to hear this!

# Problem 1
* CA law requires students to recite pledge of allegiance
* Potter family sues in federal court as a violation of the Establishment Clause
* They prepare to appeal case to SCOTUS, but new law says:
>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by writ of certiorari, appeal, or otherwise, any judgment adjudicating a claim pertaining to the interpretation of, or the validity under the U.S. Constitution of, the Pledge of Allegiance or its recitation.

> [!important]
> When facing a jurisdiction stripping statute, you have one of two arguments:
> 1. this doesn't apply here actually; or
> 2. this is unconstitutional.

- Arguments for defendant (doesn't want jurisdiction):
	- Plain reading of the statute makes it clear that this applies here.
	- Constitution explicitly gives Congress this power: Article III Exceptions Clause
	- Plenary power: reading of Article III that *McCardle* establishes.
- Arguments for plaintiff (wants jurisdiction):
	- Statutory interpretation:
		- **Statute does not clearly apply to pending cases. Congress needs to make that distinction explicit!!** 
			- This is one common line of argumentation.
			- Defense's response:
				- Wasn't McCardle pending too?
				- Statute says "any judgment," this includes judgments on the merits.
	- Constitutional argument:
		- *McCardle*: this leaves *no* avenue for SCOTUS to hear this case.
		- *McCardle:* under that case, SCOTUS was under immense pressure, Repeating McCardle here would be a really bad precedent.
		- *Why* argument:
			- There is no right without a remedy. Letting Congress strip away jurisdiction de facto takes away that right from plaintiffs.
			- Defense's response:
				- State courts are still around! You still have a remedy through them!
				- Separation of Powers: regulating judicial jurisdiction is all about Congress checking the power of the courts! This is also about 

* Q: Can SCOTUS hear this case?
	* McCardle explicitly does not apply to appeals from circuit courts
		* But... that authority still comes from a statute. And Congress just passed a new statute that overrides that appellate jurisdiction
	* We know that preventing SCOTUS from hearing constitutional cases is really bad for the country, this may be one of those "essential functions"
		* But... state courts are still around and they still have ultimate jurisdiction over this kinda stuff.
