# Review from Last Class
- There are two ways to read *Ex Parte McCardle*
	- A lot of language supports the plenary powers theory - Congress can do whatever it wants to SCOTUS's appellate jurisdiction.
		- Marbury v. Madison - Congress can't expand SCOTUS's original jurisdiction cases.
		- Strong debate on whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.
	- Congress didn't actually exercise a plenary power here. It removed one venue but kept another venue. What's important is that some venue remained for this case to get up to SCOTUS.
		- The other venue is the weird trick they do where SCOTUS issues a new writ, over which they have original jurisdiction, which is de facto a mechanism enabling it to review appeals of writs from lower cases.
- It's also possible to discount McCardle because of the political circumstances under which it was issued. But we usually don't pay attention to that.

# Sheldon v. Sill

- Michigander wants to sue Michigander, but wants diversity jurisdiction to get to federal court. So he moves his assets to a New Yorker. Congress passed a statute saying you can't do that.
- Question: can Congress control the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts?
- Answer: YES.
	- No exceptions clause for lower courts.
	- But Congress has the power to create the lower courts, and it doesn't really have to (see Article I, Section 8, and Article III, Section 1)
	- So Congress has the power to control whatever it wants about the lower courts, and thus completely control their jurisdiction.
* Congress has effectively unlimited authority to control the jurisdiction of the lower courts.
- Alternative reading: *Sheldon* is a diversity jurisdiction case. Maybe it's just a narrow case that only applies to diversity jurisdiction.
# Webster v. Doe
486 U.S. 592 (1988)
* statute gives director of CIA the power to fire anyone for any reason. Plaintiff is fired for being gay, and sues for discrimination.
	* Statutory and constitutional claims!
* Question: does this statute preclude lower courts from reviewing constitutional claims on this matter?
* Answer:
	* Statutory claims: court has no jurisdiction, because of the broad discretion given to the CIA director by this statute.
	* Constitutional claims: court *does* have jurisdiction. Congress cannot take away SCOTUS jurisdiction over constitutional claims unless they say it very clearly.
		* Consequence of this: SCOTUS gets to avoid avoid a lot of the constitutional questions! So the doctrine on this only exists in legal scholarships.
* Dissents: it's untenable that every constitutional violation has a judicial remedy. it's untenable here.
# Policy Arguments over Jurisdiction Stripping
* There are disagreements in the scholarship on whether Congress can completely deny jurisdiction to the lower courts over some issues.
	* what about controversies not outlined in article 3?
	* what about reviewing state court decisions?
## Traditional View
- There's nothing stopping state courts from being the final authority in their jurisdiction over constitutional law.
## Essential Function / Essential Role Thesis
- There are two essential functions of SCOTUS that Congress cannot get rid of :
	- UNIFORMITY - resolving conflicting interpretations of federal law
	- SUPREMACY OF FEDERAL LAW - especially the constitution - over state law. We don't trust state judges to do that by themselves!
- Other good reasons to give federal courts constitutional review powers:
	- CASELOAD - bc of modern caseloads, maintaining lower federal courts is also an essential function that Congress cannot get rid of entirely.
	- ARTICLE III PROTECTIONS - compensation, protection from being fired for good behavior.
	- SOME CASES HAVE TO BE IN FEDERAL COURT - see long list of cases in Article III. Each one begins with "all cases __"
	- Some people say all federal constitutional claims must be made in federal courts

- What if Congress takes away power to hear federal constitutional claims from both state and federal courts?
	- **Violation of due process - no remedy for constitutional violations!**
	- Constitution can no longer be enforced if Pres & Congress don't do their job

# Klein Principle
# Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co. II
* Virginia built a bridge near the PA border. PA sued the bridge and received an injunction from SCOTUS.
* Congress subsequently passed a law declaring the bridge legal
* After a storm, VA started rebuilding the bridge and PA asked for a second injunction.
* Question: can Congress overturn Article III injunctions?
* Answer: yes. kind of.
	* Typically, no. But the injunction here was an "executory, continuing decree based on the violation of a public right." Now that Congress passed this law, the public right was no longer being violated.
* Congress can amend the law going forward. This is ok in this injunction case because it's not undoing any judicial decision from the past, it's just 
# United States v. Klein
## Facts and Background
* During reconstruction, govt seized property from people loyal to Confederacy.
* In some other case, receiving a presidential pardon was found as evidence grounds to say that the person was not loyal to Confederacy.
* P had property seized but received pardon. Lower court granted to P.
* In-between lower ruling and SCOTUS hearing, Congress passed a new law saying that:
	* Pardons do not constitutive evidence of loyalty to Union. They actually constitute evidence of loyalty to the Confederacy.
	* If claimant prevailed in lower court based on pardon, SCOTUS and lower courts no longer have jurisdiction and must instead dismiss the suit.
## Question
* Is this new statute constitutional? Is this any different from *Wheeling*?
## Answer
- Statute is unconstitutional!
- Article III violation: Congress isn't merely amending the law or stripping jurisdiction. It's issuing the ruling. It's telling the courts how to decide the case.
	- This statute is different bc it's simply withholding jurisdiction as a means to an end.
	- Congress can't just tell a court to believe some facts and then cease having jurisdiction
- Article II violation: nullifying presidential pardon. Congress can't do that!
- Why this is different from Wheeling:
	- In Wheeling, the new act actually changed the facts of the case.
	- Here, the new act didn't change the underlying facts. It just said you no longer have jurisdiction in this case bc we don't like the outcome you're gonna make.
- Another point: this is intruding on separation of powers. Congress can't change what a presidential pardon means!
# Bank Markazi v. Peterson
578 U.S. 212 (2016)
* P sued Iranian bank to seize assets in the United States. While the lawsuit was ongoing, Congress passes a law saying that P should win in cases like these, even mentioning this one by name.
	* By the time this law is passed, plaintiffs already won on the merits, the only outlying question is how much money they should get
* Holding: this is constitutional.
	* Doesn't matter that it was mentioned by name
	* Doesn't matter that it only applies to a very narrow class of cases
	* Does matter that it technically affects more than one case.
# Patchak v. Zinke
583 U.S. __ (2018)
## Facts
+ Govt. seized a "Bardley Property" to grant to an Indian reservation. SCOTUS affirmed that the plaintiff had standing to litigate this.
+ In the meantime, Congress passed a law saying that this action was legal and that federal courts no longer have standing to litigate this case on the merits. District court dismissed
## Question
+ Can Congress change the statutory law applicable to a pending case? Can Congress strip federal court jurisdiction over a pending case?
## Holding
+ Yes. But its a plurality opinion!
+ Conservative plurality: This is jurisdiction stripping, which is completely different.
+ Liberal plurality: This case is about sovereign immunity. What Congress did here was just retract its waiver of sovereign immunity. This has nothing to do with jurisdiction.

>[!important] Klein takeaways
>Broad reading (not enforced): Congress cannot issue the rule of decision for a case
>Narrow reading (modern reading): Congress cannot tell courts to issue a ruling that is *unconstitutional*
- One way to reconcile this: in cases about Congressional statutes, the court already defers to Congress in doing statutory interpretation. If we adopt the broad interpretation, we take away Congress's power to amend the law
# Problem 2
> (1) No inferior federal court nor the U.S. Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction in any case pending before that court to strike down, as invalid under the U.S. Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance or its recitation.
> (2) The jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court shall not extend to any case involving the Pledge of Allegiance or its recitation.
> (3) No court of the United States, of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, shall have jurisdiction of any action pertaining to the interpretation of, or the validity under the U.S. Constitution of, the Pledge of Allegiance or its recitation.

Analyze:
(1) what constitutional concerns each raises
(2) if found to be constitutional, whether it ensures no court strikes down Pledge of Allegiance
