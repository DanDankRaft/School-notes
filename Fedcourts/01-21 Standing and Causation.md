# Review of last class
- You can care deeply about something, but that doesn't mean that you have an injury-in-fact
- But with environmental impact, how close you are to the affected area / species / whatever makes an impact about how concrete and particularized the injury is.
- Causation - injury should be caused by the defendant conduct that the plaintiff is challenging. This can be tricky when the defendant is the government - which does a lot of different things.
- Lujan - the only justice stating that buying a plane ticket would be enough is a dissenter! It leaves a lot of room to maneuver! A lot of ambiguity.

- Can Congress give any injury valid standing by attaching a bounty? *Maybe!*

- Some tricky controversies and how to challenge them:
	- Judges improperly admitted - if you are a litigant in that judge's court, you can argue that you are injured bc you have to litigate in an improper court.
	- President illegally running for a third term - if you are another competing candidate, you can sue for the injury of missing on a shot at becoming president.
# Clapper v. Amnesty International
568 U.S. 398 (2013)
### Background
- 50 USC § 1881a - allows NSA to surveil communications of civilians and non-civilians located outside the US to acquire foreign intelligence. All that's necessary is blanket approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
- Plaintiffs are human rights lawyers representing clients suspected of terrorism, suing bc they had to take costly precautionary measures to avoid having their client communications surveilled by NSA.
> [!check] What are the cognizable harms here?
> - **Occupational Harm** - hurts your business
> - **Constitutional right violated** - violation of 4th amendment right of privacy.
> - **Another constitutional right violated** - this is chilling speech; violation of 1st amendment right.

- Crucially, they don't have any evidence that any of their clients were actually surveilled by NSA.

- Second Circuit held for plaintiffs:
	- Injuries were fairly traceable to § 1881a bc precautions were taken in response to "objectively reasonable likelihood" of govt. action
## Question
- Is the causation strong enough between P's precautionary measures and the surveillance statute?

> [!info] This ended up being a perfect 5-4 split along liberal-conservative lines.
> One theory: this is about the merits of the case. The majority opinion creates a catch-22 scenario where nobody can get the actual knowledge necessary to challenge this statute in court
## Majority Holding (Alito)
- NO.
- The standard - "threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact"
	- Dissent uses a different standard of "substantial risk" which is also usually acceptable.
- **This injury is not certainly impending** - this violates both the injury-in-fact and the causation standards.
	- Purely speculative that government will or actually does target plaintiffs' clients.
		- For example, it relies on **speculation on the conduct of other parties,** e.g., the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
- Even if it was, the government will have many other channels for surveillance beyond this statute, so a favorable ruling doesn't do anything.
- In response to precautionary measures:
	- **Plaintiffs cannot merely manufacture standing by taking precautions to avoid some harm.**
	- Holding otherwise "waters down the fundamental requirements of Article III"??
> [!caution] Manufactured Standing
> - Taking precautionary measures to avoid some perceived injury is not enough to create an injury-in-fact; BUT
> - Intentionally getting yourself injured by the defendant's conduct (such as intentionally violating an unconstitutional law) does create an injury-in-fact
- How do we distinguish *Havens Realty/Cruz* from *Clapper*
	- One theory: *Clapper* is about national security, and *Havens Realty/Cruz* is... not. Court is famously skittish about national security!
	- Another theory: this is about *creating the net* vs *walking into the net*. You can put yourself in a position to get injured, but you can't just pretend that there's some injury in order to get standing..
## Dissent (Breyer)
- Federal courts find standing for "reasonably likely" and "very highly likely" harms all the time!
- Federal courts find present injuries in precautions taken to avoid probable future injuries all the time!
- Kind of confused if probability plays a role.
- There's a very high likelihood of harm here bc this sounds like something the government would do, it has the power to do it, and it has a motive to do it.
# FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine
602 U.S. __ (2024)
- **Background:** a bunch of pro-life medical associations sued FDA for loosening regulations on mifepristone, an abortion drug. Injuries alleged:
	- Use of the drug would lead some women to require emergency care and divert resources from other patients
	- Would force doctors opposed to abortion to treat users of mifepristone
	- They had to spend resources combatting FDA's actions.
- **Question:** to any of these constitute a traceable injury?
- **Holding:** nope.
	- For the injury that doctors would have to treat mifepristone patients: they failed to sufficiently demonstrate that - federal law protects doctors who opposed to treating mifepristone users.
		- The underlying type of injury - **injury to conscience** - is valid!
	- The other alleged injuries are too speculative.
	- Also:
> [!important] Associations can only sue for injuries that they have actually suffered

- This was a unanimous decision. Why?
	- It's quite clear on the caselaw.. When you're complaining on a regulation / lack of regulation *on someone else*, you don't have standing. This is word for word from Scalia's opinion on Lujan.
	- More cynical decision: not good for conservatives if they strike down mifepristone deregulation in a presidential election year.

# Havens Realty Corp v. Coleman
455 U.S. 363 (1982)
- **Background:** plaintiffs were "testers" who posed as prospective tenants to find unlawful practices in the rental market. They found that an apartment building violated a racial discrimination statute bc a white tester was offered an apartment but a black tenant was not.
- **Legal question:** is "manufactured standing," where a plaintiffs goes out of their way to create an injury, valid?
- **Holding:** yes. Even if the black tester knew that he would get rejected in advance, he had standing. **He received incorrect information in violation of a statutory right.**
	- **This is an informational injury** - very common grounds for FOIA-related lawsuits
- **Unclear whether this decision is still good law**
# FEC v. Cruz
596 U.S. ___ (2022)
- **Background:** Ted Cruz intentionally violated some campaign financing rule to challenge its constitutionality. Can't use more than $250k from political donations to pay back loans.
- **Holding:** Cruz had standing. This case is different from *Clapper* bc he actually suffered an injury. "Injury resulting from "
- Majority opinions has a huge favorable citation to *Havens Realty*

> [!info] It's not about whether the plaintiff  went out of their way to get injured, it's about whether an injury was actually inflicted on them by the defendant!

# Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins
578 U.S. 330 (2016)
- **Background:** Spokeo is a background search website that shows people's personal information. It had wrong information about Robins that made it harder for him to get a job (he appeared to be overqualified for all of the positions he wanted). He sued under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970.
- **Question:** is the violation of a statutory right, by itself, enough to constitute a sufficient injury?
- **Holding:** yes, but remanded. You need to show that the plaintiff himself suffered the injury (particularity), and that the injury is "concerete." But this is not the same as showing that the injury is "tangible." You can have standing with an "intangible harm"
	- What the hell is a tangible harm? What the hell is a concrete harm?

+ Your injury has to be both particularized and concrete. 9th circuit correctly found that the injury is particularized, but that's not enough.
	+ Two types of concrete injuries: tangible and intangible. Both are fine, it's juts that intangible injuries require higher burden of proof??
+ What makes an injury concrete? look to congress's intent when creating a statutory injury, but also see if it has a connection to historical common law.

- Big question: how serious is SCOTUS about Spokeo concreteness criteria? See TransUnion
# TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez
594 U.S. __ (2021)
- **Background:** defendant offered a system to merchants that checked a person's first and last name against a list of terrorists. This system returned a lot of false positives that prevented many people from buying cars for example.
  Class action lawsuit. Some people (like Ramirez) had their name on the list get leaked, but others did not.
  There was a statutory violation here but idr which one.
- **Question:** does the whole class have standing or only the subset who had their name leaked?
- **Holding:** Only the smaller class. The rest of the class lacked a "concrete" harm.
	- Merely having a statutory violation is not enough 


- Standing doctrine doesn't have a whole lot to do with originalist history, so a lot of originalists (like Thomas) don't like it!

# Problem 5
- Plaintiff is a disabled woman who needs a lot of accommodations when staying at a hotel. She is a "tester" who finds hotel websites which violate the ADA by not listing information about disability accommodations required by the act.
- With this hotel, she checked its website, but did not make an attempt to book a room there.

### Standing?
| Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
