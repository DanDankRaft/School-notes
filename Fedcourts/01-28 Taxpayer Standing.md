- [x] 366-83: Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation
- [ ] Problem 7

# Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation
551 U.S. 587 (2007)
## Background
- President Bush used general-purpose executive branch funds to create a new agency that would help religious non-profits receive federal funding.
- Plaintiffs sued, alleging that this agency violates the Establishment Clause
- Standing theory - they are taxpayers, and thus their tax money is being used to violate the Establishment Clause
- Relevant case: *Flast v. Cohen* (1968):
	- Congress created a program that would distribute federal funds to religious schools.
	- Plaintiffs sued under the same theory and got standing.
	- Majority opinion: *Flast* creates a "special exception" to Article III standing that doesn't apply here.
## Legal Question
- Can you extend *Flast* to apply here?
- What are the rules for establishing standing merely on the basis that you're a taxpayer.
## Plurality Holding (Alito)
- No standing!
- *Flast* exception is as follows:
	1. Taxpayer "must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment linked" - IE, must be a direct exercise of Congressional power under the taxing and spending clause (Article 1, Section 8)
	2. Taxpayer "must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged" - the injury must be that Congress exceeded the constitutional powers allotted to them *by the taxing and spending clause*, not just that they generally exceeded their allotted Congressional power.
> [!danger] what does #2 mean

- This case fails on step 1. This wasn't congressional action, but executive action.
- Why is this reading of Flast precedent good? If we take P's approach, everyone would have standing to challenge every executive action. No longer a personal injury.
- But doesn't this create scenarios where nobody has standing to challenge executive violations of the Establishment clause? Maybe, but then it's Congress's job to fix that.

## Scalia Concurrence
- *Flast* is a bad precedent that should be overturned.
- There are two types of injuries when you sue the government "as a taxpayer":
	- Wallet injury: your tax burden would be lower but for the alleged constitutional violation. This one is concrete and particularized, but tends to pose difficult traceability and redressability challenges.
	- Psychic Injury: taxpayer is mentally displeasured that money is being spent unlawfully. This one is never concrete, but always traceable and redressable.
- In short: Flast is a bad precedent bc it allows standing for psychic injuries, which are stupid and should never be allowed. It merely tends to hide this behind some arbitrary restrictions.
- Agrees with the plurality's holding bc the injury here is psychic.
## Souter dissent
- The injury that "your taxpayers are being used to support a religious institution" is deeply rooted in history - it's the whole reason the Establishment Clause exists! It's thus not a psychic injury
- Plurality's reading of *Flast* doesn't make a lot of sense either: why does it matter whether the action came from the legislative or executive branches? For the purposes of separation of powers and judicial review, this shouldn't matter to the court!
