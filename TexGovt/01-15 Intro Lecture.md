# About Professor Erben
- Legislative director for Greg Abbott in 2015. His main job was to review all the bills that were passed by the legislature, figure out what they mean, how to respond to them, whether to veto them, etc.

# Confederate Monuments
- Legislature, Texas Historical Commission, State Preservation Board

- Strevos v. Perry - due to a constitutional amendment, the new state supreme court building included plaques commemorating confederate soldiers. About 20 years later, the plaques were removed and replaced with different language that still mentioned confederate soldiers but in a less celebratory light.
	- Holding: Govt. Code requires approval of the Historical Commission approval of any new confederate monument.
- Five liberal legislators send a letter to Govt. Abbott asking to form a task force so they remove confederate monuments from the capitol. Importantly, they don't ask the governor to call a special session.
	- Why do this? Why not meet with the governor beforehand? They wanted a media shitstorm.
	- Governor didn't send any response.

- In the summer of 2015, UT president removed a few confederate statues from the main UT mall. He did it in the middle of the night. A confederate association sues over first amendment claims, and loses in federal court bc they couldn't demonstrate any injury.

- In 1959, a confederate monument with a plaque saying "civil war wasn't about slavery" is erected on capitol grounds.
	- In 2017, bipartisan letter from 45 legislators asks to remove the plaque. Nothing passes through the legislature.
	- In 2019, the State Preservation Board votes to remove it.

- 2019 Debate over SB 1663
	- Would've required 2/3 vote of the House and Senate to remove, relocate, or alter any monument over 25 years.

# Obergefell
- First thing to tell your staff when the opinion comes out: READ IT.
- What does Obergefell actually do?
	- Texas must recognize same-sex marriages lawfully performed in other states
	- Texas must license same-sex marriages
- What does Obergefell *not* address?
	- Religious freedom
	- Spousal benefits
	- Children and adoption
	- Divorce
	- Wills and Estates
	- Inheritance
	- Intestacy
	- Community Property

- Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1999):
	- A government may not substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion unless the government agency demonstrates that the application of the burden to the person:
		- Is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and
		- Is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
- Pastor Protection Act (2015):
	- A religious organization, any individual employed by it, or any clergy or minister may not be required to solemnize any marriage or provide services in connection to the marriage if the action would cause the organization or individual to violate a sincerely held religious belief

- A few days after Obergefell is released, ERS publishes a memo saying that same-sex spouses of state employees are automatically enrolled in insurance.
- The day after, the governor publishes a memo to all state agency heads saying that "forcing someone to recognize same-sex marriages is against TRFRA." Prioritize 
	- Why does he do this? To get people off his back!
> [!info] The governor has no authority to issue any binding memorandum on anything except during natural disasters

- A few conservative legislators sent a letter to Abbott saying "hey please call a special session so we can respond to Obergefell."

- Lt. Gov. Patrick requested an AG opinion from Paxton as to whether clerks and judges could refuse to officiate same sex marriages or issue licenses thereof
	- Patrick and Paxton are both buddies, Patrick knew what answer he was going to get.
	- Paxton responds: officials retain religious freedoms that allow them to refuse to issue licenses.

- *Pidgeon v. Turner*:
	- City of Houston started offering spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Taxpayers brought action against the city, seeking an injunction prohibiting the city from offering these benefits. Trial court issues preliminary injunction, circuit court
	- SCOTX:
		- Trial court on remand was not required to proceed "consistent with" circuit court of appeals decision prohibiting same-sex marriage 
		- But court of appeals dissolution of temporary injunction did not preclude taxpayers from seeking further remedy.
		- Refused to address *Obergefell*
	- Why? All SCOTX justices are elected as Rs and have to face a primary.
- Prof. thinks that legislature was silly to not address all of the other issues affecting marriage before Obergefell came out. If they did, plaintiffs in *Pidgeon* would've won easily.

- *Masterpiece Cakeshop* - SCOTUS kind of dodges the question about religious belief, they say that the commission violated free exercise clause by making disparaging remarks about plaintiff's religious beliefs.
- *303 Creative* - the state cannot force you to have expressive conduct that you disagree with.
